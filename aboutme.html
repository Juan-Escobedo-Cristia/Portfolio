            <p>My name is Juan Escobedo and I like to diversify within the skills I know and learn because experiencing new things enriches everyone. At this moment in time, I am applying for jobs in the UX UI world.
            <br><br>Thanks to the teaching style of my college and bootcamp, I am very used to work in mid or long term proyects in a team or by myself. Working in teams is an essential skill that I enjoy doing because it enables each team member to focus on certain aspects of the proyect in order to improve efficiency while learning from each other.
            <br><br>Although I value positively the ability of working in groups I think that knowing how to work individualy is one of the most important skills. This is because knowing how to resolve issues alone prepares you for every complication that can appear.
